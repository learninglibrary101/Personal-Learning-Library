## Disadvantages:
If a company's developers want control over back-end infrastructure MBaaS might not be an ideal fit. Even minor changes to the back end may be impossible with MBaaS because developers do not have complete access to the infrastructure located in the vendor's data center Also, overly complex apps do not work well with MBaaS because the back-end infrastructure is designed to be universal and does not usually support features unique to one particular app.
